### PRIME FACTORS

## DIVIDE

# loop through numbers

# divide by each prime number

# limit / 2? square root? how do I use the fact that only 1 factor > sqrt. try up to square root. is remainder always prime?

# count how many times

# until 1

## recursive solution with memoization?

## store prime factors for each number when generating primes? 


## LIST

# list primes up to limit 

# start at 0

# recurse using next prime in list

# store in global list using product as index and dictionary as value

# increment current prime

# stop when over limit

# efficient? do I determine prime factors only once per number? count to check

# compare speed
